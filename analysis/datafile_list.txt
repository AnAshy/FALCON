Expanded list of protein accessions and their intensities for all matching proteins (not just the best match).
Based on Supplemental Table S3 - Protein group table, from:
Gholami, A. M., Hahne, H., Wu, Z., Auer, F. J., Meng, C., Wilhelm, M., & Kuster, B. (2013, August 15). Global Proteome Analysis of the NCI-60 Cell Line Panel. Cell Reports. Retrieved from http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S221112471300380X

**** Entrez_and_IPI_unique.csv ****

Entrez Gene to IPI ID mapping; created from the list of IPI IDs in the
NCI60 proteomic dataset from Gholami et al, as well as genes from
Human Recon 2.02. The conversion was handled by DAVID
(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) on 08/22/2013.
